window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The #1 </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestseller, now in an expanded audiobook edition that includes detailed historical context for the democracy-threatening Ukrainian conflict and a call to action for modern times.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>This edition includes the bestselling original essay collection </b><b><i>On Tyranny</i></b><b>, read by the author.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>In this exclusive audiobook edition, which includes&nbsp;eight hours of new content, Snyder combines the original essays from <i>On Tyranny</i> with twenty new lessons that answer the questions everyone is asking about this war. With forays into history, he clarifies the causes of the Russian invasion and the meaning of Ukrainian resistance, and explains the war's connections to threats to democracy here in the United States and around the world. Linking past and present, speaking only from notes, he guides the listener into the larger moral universe of <i>On Tyranny</i>.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>This edition also includes <i>On Tyranny</i>, the bestselling essay collection that illustrates how various countries and governments have managed to protect against totalitarianism throughout history despite ever-present threats from many factions.&nbsp;Snyder cautions that unless we learn from these disruptive and disturbing occurrences, they will continue. This important call to arms and roadmap for resistance provides invaluable ideas for how we can preserve our freedoms in the uncertain years to come.</p> <p><b>“Timothy Snyder reasons with unparalleled clarity, throwing the past and future into sharp relief. He has written the rare kind of book that can be read in one sitting but will keep you coming back to help regain your bearings.”—Masha Gessen, about </b><b><i>On Tyranny</i></b></p>";

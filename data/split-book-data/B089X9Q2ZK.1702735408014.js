window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> Audio best seller | Amazon Editor's pick | Audible Editor's pick </b></p> <p>After more than 500 years of exile, the heir to the empyre is wary about his sudden reassignment to active duty on the Goblin Warâ€™s front lines. His mission to rescue an outpost leads to a dead-end canyon deep inside enemy territory, and his suspicion turns to dread when he discovers the stronghold doesn't exist. But whoever went to the trouble of planning his death to look like a casualty of war didn't know he would be assigned to the Seventh Sikaria Auxiliary Squadron. In the depths of an unforgiving jungle, a legend is about to be born, and the world of Elan will never be the same.&nbsp;</p> <p>From Michael J. Sullivan, the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>USA Today</i>, and <i>Washington Post</i> best-selling author, a new adventure begins with the first book in The Rise and Fall trilogy. Although this series is set in the same world as the Riyria novels and the Legends of the First Empire books, it is a stand-alone tale. As such, no prior knowledge of the other works is required to enjoy this tale to its fullest.</p>";

window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>With <i>A Warrior's Path</i>, Davis Ashura introduced fans to Arisa, an ancient world rich with history and myth where humanity struggles to survive the never-ending battle with the demon Suwraith and her hordes of Chimeras. Now Ashura's best-selling epic continues with <i>A Warrior's Knowledge</i>. </p> <p>Rukh Shektan and Jessira Grey struggle to reach the OutCaste city of Stronghold before winter's snow bars all passages. Their travels test Rukh's will and hope as Chimeras hound their footsteps, but the most difficult challenge proves to be Stronghold itself. The city is not as Jessira described. </p> <p>Rector Bryce and Mira Terrell form a reluctant alliance. Rector is forced to do the bidding of Dar'El Shektan - the man he betrayed - and works with Mira. They seek a means to bring down House Shektan's most bitter rival, Hal'El Wrestiva, the man responsible for Rukh's banishment. Meanwhile, Bree and Jaresh continue their search for the Sil Lor Kum. Danger lurks, and the withering knife murders continue as Hal'El Wrestiva, the SuDin of the Sil Lor Kum, furthers his own intentions. </p> <p>And high in the heavens and watching over the world is Suwraith. Her clouded mind is clear for the first time in millennia, and she makes her own plans. The sorrow bringer has learned of Stronghold's existence. </p>";

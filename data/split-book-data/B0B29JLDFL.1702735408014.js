window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A power to gain. Prices too high to pay. No one cheats death forever.</b></p> <p>Digby finally has everything he wants: The heist went off without a hitch, the shards of the Heretic Seed are in his possession, and Autem is in disarray. All he has to do is unlock the power he’s stolen. But it seems that restoring the Seed to its former glory is easier said than done. Something has gone wrong, and it’s up to Digby to fix it, whether he wants to or not.</p> <p>Trapped within a twisted realm of memories, he’s forced to compete against the souls of past Heretics in a game of death with his existence on the line. To escape, he will have to play nice with the few allies he can find, then make his way to the finish line all while uncovering a conflict that has been hidden throughout the centuries. To make matters worse, until he can find a way home, everyone back in Vegas will need to step up to fill the void left by his absence.</p> <p>When the dust settles, he may find that the power he seeks will cost him more than he bargained for.</p>";
